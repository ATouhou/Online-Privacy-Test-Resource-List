Please do not ask or open any new ticket which is on the following todo list already - to not waste time or to possible confuse people. Thank you!. :+1: 

**ToDo:**
- [ ] Add github-gh page (front-page)
- [x] ~~Add an page index to easier navigate to the specific sections~~
- [x] ~~Better view - table view? (low-prio)~~
- [x] Mention [HTTPS Client Identification Using SSL/TLS](https://www.muni.cz/research/publications/1299983?lang=en)
- [ ] Mention document fingerprinting (basically metadata), same goes to pictures, ... 
- [ ] Add small overview what the page exactly do
- [x] ~Add a warning that all of these pages mostly require JavaScript which must be e.g allowed via NoScript/umatrix.~
- [ ] Integrate googles fingerprinting ? -> [source](http://www.scottsmitelli.com/articles/youtube-audio-content-id) + mention if it's impossible to [prevent](http://www.w3.org/wiki/images/7/7d/Is_preventing_browser_fingerprinting_a_lost_cause.pdf).
- [ ] Some pages itself may collecting a online/offline database?! Research + proof needed. But it would make sense if they sell the collected data to Google, Amazon and others ... 
- [ ] Mark deprecated (because fixed by OS/Browser) test with an icon? It would help to identify if that is already fixed or not to avoid to submit unnecessary data and of course it would costs your time ... 
- [x] ~Add (maybe) gitter chat~


**I like to add the following page:**
Small descibtion and overview of the requested site.

**Why you think PORTAC needs this page - is it unique or already covered by other sites?**
Describe why we need it.

**Does the Site collects (and if yes) even sells collected statistics?**
Please provide research regardings to this. If it's not mentioned or covered set it to N/A.
