Contributing to POTARC
======================

Contributions to POTARC are welcome and encouraged, but please have a look through the guidelines in this document before raising an issue, or writing something for the project.


Using issues
------------

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Online-Privacy-Test-Resource-List/issues) is the preferred channel for reporting bugs, requesting new features and submitting pull requests. If you want more attention you can contact me via Discord.

* Check twice the existent links and documents before you submit something!
* Ensure you have permission to submit some external materials if it's not your own.


Reporting bugs
--------------

Well structured, detailed bug reports are hugely valuable for the project.

Guidelines for reporting bugs:

 - Check the issue search to see if it has already been reported.
 - Isolate the problem to a simple test case, in case something is offline, ensure it's really offline.
 - Be specific on every report, this means more details are better in order to discuss the problem/idea etc.

Please provide any additional details associated with the bug/problem/idea, if it's browser/extension or screen density specific, or only happens with a certain configuration or data.


Pull requests
-------------

Clear, concise pull requests are excellent at continuing the project's community driven growth. But please review [these guidelines](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) and the guidelines below before starting work on the project.

Guidelines:

 - Please create an issue first:
   - For bugs, we can discuss the fixing approach, keep in mind that I might reject your Pull Request at any point without explanation
   - For enhancements, we can discuss if it is within the project scope and avoid duplicate effort
 - Use Tabs for indentation, not spaces please
 - Please make your commits in logical sections with clear commit messages
